This will ensure that you are fully prepared and ready to address any type of grooming emergency. The First Aid lesson will teach you how to prevent accidents and injuries, and to respond to these situations should they occur. You'll also learn to build your Groomer's First Aid Kit, assess a dog's vitals, and perform life-saving procedures. Being able to quickly respond to these situations will make you a better and more confident groomer!</p>

                      <h4>Submit Your Externship Application</h4>
                      <p>After completing the online training with a grade of B or higher in your practicum units and paying your course fees in full, you'll fill out an externship application. This is your opportunity to share your preferences with your facilitator, such as location or type of grooming facility.</p>
                      <h4>Placement Matching</h4>
                      <p>Your Externship Facilitator will review your application and work with you to secure the best placement for your hands-on training alongside a professional groomer.</p>
                      <h4>Receive Your Placement & Sign Documentation</h4>
                      <p>Within 14 days of application approval, you'll receive your placement details. Your facilitator will provide all required documentation, which you must sign before starting your externship.</p>
                      <h4>Begin Your Externship</h4>
                      <p>You'll complete 80 hours of unpaid, hands-on training in a real grooming environment, gaining practical experience and confidence in your skills.</p>
                      <h4>Track Your Hours & Get Evaluated</h4>
                      <p>During your externship you'll log your hours and complete an evaluation of your experience. Your grooming supervisor will also submit a final evaluation of your performance and skills.</p>
                      <h4>Receive Your Certificate of Completion</h4>
                      <p>Once all externship requirements are metâincluding your hours log and evaluationsâyou'll receive your official QC Certificate of Completion, recognizing both your coursework and real-world training.</p>
