                </QuestionAnswer>
                <QuestionAnswer question="What type of payment plans does QC offer?" index={i++}>
                  <p className="mb-0">When you enroll with QC, you can choose to either receive a discount to pay your tuition in full OR opt for a tuition payment plan. On a payment plan, you pay an initial deposit to enroll, then regular monthly payments. Monthly payments are withdrawn on the date of your choosing so you can schedule your payments to coincide with your budget.</p>
                </QuestionAnswer>
                <QuestionAnswer question="How does the money back guarantee work?" index={i++}>
                  <p>QC&apos;s 21-day guarantee is there to help you make an informed decision about your education. From the day you receive your online student center login, you have a full three weeks to review the course guides, books, and assignments in order to decide whether your course is right for you. If you decide that it&apos;s not a good fit, simply contact the school to arrange a refund of your tuition. You&apos;ll be asked to return any course material you have to the school, and these must be unused.</p>
                  <p className="mb-0"><em>Note: that since the 21-day guarantee is made for you to decide whether to take the course or not. A full tuition refund cannot be granted if you&apos;ve already completed and submitted course work to your tutor.</em></p>
                </QuestionAnswer>
                <QuestionAnswer question="What if I miss a tuition payment?" index={i++}>
                  <p>Sometimes life gets in the way, and that&apos;s okay! If you know in advance that you won&apos;t be able to make a tuition payment, simply contact your student advisor who will be happy to work with you to update your payment schedule. </p>
                  <p>If you need to take a break from tuition payments for a month or two, that&apos;s perfectly fine! Again, just call your student advisor to make those arrangements ahead of time.</p>
                  <p>If you forget and an attempted monthly payment doesn&apos;t go through, a student advisor will contact you to make arrangements to get you back on track.</p>
                  <p className="mb-0"><em>Note: students can only access their online student center if their account is in good standing. If payments are missed, the student center is placed &ldquo;on hold&rdquo; until payments are caught up. While you won&apos;t lose any work, you won&apos;t be able to submit assignments to your tutor during this time.</em></p>

                  <p>With QC&apos;s online courses, you work at your own pace. You decide how much time per week you want to spend developing your grooming skills.

Typically, students who work on their grooming assignments for a short period each week will complete their online course within six months to a year.</p>
                  <p className="mb-0">Keep in mind that you have a full two years to complete your dog grooming course, so you can schedule your groomer training around your lifestyle!</p>
                </QuestionAnswer>
                <QuestionAnswer question="How exactly do the hands-on grooming assignments and practicum dog grooming units work?" index={i++}>
                  <p>You will complete the practical grooming assignments and practicum units by working with real dogs. Your course materials contain guidelines for finding dogs to work with. In order to get the most out of your dog groomer education, you are encouraged to work on as many different dogs as you can find!</p>
                  <p className="mb-0">To groom these dogs, you will need to set up an at-home grooming workspace. Your course will guide you through setting up your workspace, and your tutor will advise you on your workspace before you start grooming dogs, to make sure the space is safe and practical for both you and your furry clients!</p>
                </QuestionAnswer>
                <QuestionAnswer question="Do I need a state or provincial dog grooming license to work in the industry?" index={i++}>
                  <p>Dog Grooming is an unregulated field in most states and provinces. You should always double-check local regulations, but odds are you do not need any kind of dog groomer license or specific education (including a minimum number of training hours) in order to become a dog groomer.</p>
                  <p className="mb-0">There are a number of dog grooming associations that you can usually join by paying an annual membership fee. In most cases, these associations also have their own certification/qualification exams or requirements. QC&apos;s online dog grooming course was written to meet the requirements of the National Dog Groomers Association of America. Completing the online dog grooming course will not only train you to become a successful professional dog groomer but will also prepare you to take the NDGAA Certification Exam, should you choose to take it.</p>

                <QuestionAnswer question="Do I need prior training or experience as a dog trainer before taking this course?" index={i++}>
                  <p className="mb-0">Not at all! The online dog training course will teach you everything you need to know about becoming a professional dog trainer from the ground up. While it always helps to have experience training your own dog(s), it&apos;s definitely not a requirement to take this course!</p>
                </QuestionAnswer>
                <QuestionAnswer question="Will I need to purchase anything else to complete the dog groomer course?" index={i++}>
                  <p className="mb-0">If you have a dog at home, odds are you already have the basics like dog treats, a crate, a treat pouch and probably a clicker. If not, you&apos;ll want to obtain these tools for your dog training class. You might also want to invest in different types of leashes, collars, harnesses, and more, however these are not required to complete the course.</p>

                <QuestionAnswer question="What methods do you teach as part of the dog training class?" index={i++}>
                  <p>QC&apos;s dog training program was developed using science-based training methods. QC&apos;s experts do not believe in using force or coercion to teach a dog new behaviors or to correct unwanted behaviors. Rather, students are taught to analyze a dog&apos;s behavior to determine the best method suited for each dog individually. Once you understand how a dog learns, teaching it becomes a piece of cake!</p>
                  <p className="mb-0">As a general rule, QC follows the &ldquo;Least Invasive, Minimally Aversive&rdquo; approach to dog training. You&apos;ll learn how to encourage a dog to make good choices, and how to encourage a handler to develop a bond of trust and respect with their dog.</p>

                <QuestionAnswer question="Do I need a state or provincial dog training license to work in the industry?" index={i++}>

                  <p>The Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers (CCPDT) is an independent certifying organization for professional dog trainers and is highly regarded as the gold standard in dog training. There are two certifications most trainers aspire to achieve in their career: The CPDT-KA (Certified Professional Dog Trainer - Knowledge Assessed) and CPDT-KSA (Certified Professional Dog Trainer - Knowledge and Skills Assessed).</p>
                  <p className="mb-0">The online dog training course provided by QC was developed to prepare students for the CPDT-KA exam.

                  <p className="mb-0">If you decide to work in a dog training school, you&apos;ll have a regular salary. If you choose a freelance dog training career, your salary will be less steady but you&apos;ll be able to set your own rates and hours.
