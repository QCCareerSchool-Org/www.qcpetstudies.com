This will ensure that you are fully prepared and ready to address any type of grooming emergency.  The First Aid units will teach you how to prevent accidents and injuries, and to respond to these situations should they occur. You'll also learn to build your Groomer's First Aid Kit, assess a dog's vitals, and perform life-saving procedures.  Being able to quickly respond to these situations will make you a better and more confident groomer!</p>
